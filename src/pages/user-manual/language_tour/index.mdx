# Language Tour

This section covers the syntax of Opshin and in particular the available Python language features.

## OpShin is Python

As a general disclaimer we would like to point
out that OpShin is a restricted version of Python.
We encourage you to always try to write code the way
you would do it in a normal Python program.
Play around to see what is accepted by the compiler and what not.
If the compiler accepts your code, the code
is safe to run (the only notable exception are type downcasts, covered later).

The main goal of OpShin is that you can express
the smart contract logic the way you want -
hence the choice of Python, which is designed to be
simple and intuitive.

If you find yourself going to great lengths to satisfy
the OpShin compiler, please do open an Issue
at the GitHub repository.
We are always looking for feedback to simplify 
the experience of coding with OpShin.
