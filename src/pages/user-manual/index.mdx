[Opshin](https://opshin.opshin.dev/opshin/) is a pythonic language for writing smart contracts on the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) blockchain.
The goal of Opshin is to reduce the barrier of entry in Smart Contract development on Cardano.
Opshin is a strict subset of [Python](https://python.org/), this is means anyone who knows Python can get up to speed on Opshin pretty quickly.

## What is a Smart Contract on Cardano?

On Cardano, funds are stored at addresses. An address can be controlled by a cryptographic key, the secret for unlocking it being only known
to a specific user.
The alternative is a _Smart Contract_ - this is some encoded logic that controls unlocking funds from the address.
In particular, this logic just _validates_ that funds may be unlocked from the address based on how they are spent. For this reason,
this kind of smart contract is often referred to as _Spending Validator_.

Other contracts also exist i.e. to validate minting of native tokens, withdrawal of stake rewards or certification of stake pools.

## Sample Code

The following contract validates that the signature of a special user is present in a transaction.
The signature is specified by a third party and attached to an [UTxO](./eutxo_crash_course) sent to the contract.
The receiver can then construct a transaction where they unlock the funds from the contract.
The contract allows this when it is provided the signature of the receiver.

```python
# gift.py
from opshin.prelude import *


@dataclass()
class WithdrawDatum(PlutusData):
    pubkeyhash: bytes


def validator(context: ScriptContext) -> None:
    datum: WithdrawDatum = own_datum_unsafe(context)
    sig_present = False
    for s in context.tx_info.signatories:
        if datum.pubkeyhash == s:
            sig_present = True
    assert sig_present, "Required signature missing"
```

## Why opshin?

- 100% valid Python. Leverage the existing tool stack for Python, syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, unit-testing, property-based testing, verification
- Intuitive. Just like Python.
- Flexible. Imperative, functional, the way you want it.
- Efficient & Secure. Static type inference ensures strict typing and optimized code.
